Your business goals drive our approach to web design. Once the purpose of your web presence is clear we work with you to design and build a website that will focus on accomplishing your goals.

A modern website must display on more platforms, a multitude of screen sizes and be delivered over networks that are slower than you or I are used to.

In the 21st century some parts of the developed world are still only served by unreliable and slow connections. If your business or your customers are based in one of these locations then this will effect the overall design and implementation of your project. On the other hand, if you know that your audience are sitting in front of large screens, running the latest browser software, connecting via super fast broadband, then you know you can be more extravagant in the kind of content you wish to deliver.

A good general approach is to build a website using the "mobile first approach" that works wonderfully well on small screen mobile devices and then add further content when a larger screen is detected. The mobile first approach delivers the smallest load possible to achieve the projects goals without making the mobile user wait.

You may have the budget to create multiple web sites targeted at multiple audiences. Whatever your situation, rest assured we will focus on delivering the most appropriate solution for you and your audience.
