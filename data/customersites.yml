  blurb: propertycostablancaspain.com is one of a number of real estate portals I have developed and implemented for a group of estate agents in Spain. The property listings are stored in a cloud hosted NoSQL database and are managed using a bespoke CMS (Content Management System). The website is built using HUGO an extremely fast static site builder and hosted in the cloud distributed to multiple data centres. Ongoing monthly costs for hosting are a fraction of what they paid for their previous system.
