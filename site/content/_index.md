### Is this for me?

If you are planning a new website or updating your current website and you have prioritized speed, security, easy content management and reduced costs, then please contact me to talk about your plans.

### What type of website is suited to the improved static cloud hosted paradigm?

Whether your organisation needs a single page website, a multi-page information website, a blog style website, an inventory focused website (real estate listings, holiday rentals, car sales) then a static cloud hosted website will be an appropriate choice.

### Aren't static websites an old 'limited' technology?

Before 'Dynamic' websites, we actually had 'Static' websites. Driven by the need to find a solution to owner managed content, the web industry focused on the hosted CMS (Content Management System). The Dynamic hosted CMS movement was driven by such systems as WordPress and Drupal. Static Site Generators existed but required users to have a high degree of technical knowledge. With the recent rise of the cloud, vast amounts of affordable computing power are now available to anyone. This has led to a renaissance in the Static Site approach to websites. Now we have Cloud based CMS systems, the need for Dynamic hosted CMS systems has been removed. Micro-services allow us to add functionality for every business need. There is nothing old or limited about static websites. On the contrary, static is the right choice for your organisation.
