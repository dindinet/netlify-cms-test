<h2 id="when-you-understand-your-cutomers-and-your-customers-understand-your-offer-magic-happens">When you understand your cutomers and your customers understand your offer, magic happens.</h2>

<h3 id="approach">Approach</h3>

<p>What we know. Building a website without understanding visitor needs is bound to fail. And
grabbing a fashionable website template to shoehorn your content into, will not create the wins you desire.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, your website should predominantly focus on helping visitors achieve their goals (and therefore yours). To do this just be very clear about your offer and make it very easy for visitors to obtain it. Start with your value proposisition.</p>

<p>Once you have nailed your value proposition and planned what a visitor journey might look like, we start quickly with a minimum viable site setup to monitor visitor behaviour. Over the following weeks, we work with you to facilitate your content experiments to increase conversion. We can continue to support you for as long as you need or train your team to go it alone.</p>

<p>The behind closed doors design and build leading to heraldic website launch is great for rudderless fantasy projects with money to burn but not the way to reach your goals and, ultimately, grow your organisation.</p>

<p>The sole purpose of your web pages should be to move the visitor to a desired goal. Any negative force (friction) that prevents visitors from
reaching the goal should be removed. Any positive force (lubricant) that propels the visitor towards the goal needs to be added.</p>

<p>If you are planning a new website or updating your current website and you have prioritized speed, security, easy content management and reduced costs, then please contact me to talk about your plans.</p>

<h3 id="what-type-of-website-is-suited-to-the-improved-static-cloud-hosted-paradigm">What type of website is suited to the improved static cloud hosted paradigm?</h3>

<p>Whether your organisation needs a single page website, a multi-page information website, a blog style website, an inventory focused website (real estate listings, holiday rentals, car sales) then a static cloud hosted website will be an appropriate choice.</p>

<h3 id="aren-t-static-websites-an-old-limited-technology">Aren&rsquo;t static websites an old &lsquo;limited&rsquo; technology?</h3>

<p>Before &lsquo;Dynamic&rsquo; websites, we actually had &lsquo;Static&rsquo; websites. Driven by the need to find a solution to owner managed content, the web industry focused on the hosted CMS (Content Management System). The Dynamic hosted CMS movement was driven by such systems as WordPress and Drupal. Static Site Generators existed but required users to have a high degree of technical knowledge. With the recent rise of the cloud, vast amounts of affordable computing power are now available to anyone. This has led to a renaissance in the Static Site approach to websites. Now we have Cloud based CMS systems, the need for Dynamic hosted CMS systems has been removed. Micro-services allow us to add functionality for every business need. There is nothing old or limited about static websites. On the contrary, static is the right choice for your organisation.</p>
